# DTRegister
A project to emulate how a register at a retail environment would work. 

Features:
-Allows for the user to clock in and out for shifts and breaks
-Tracks how long a user was clocked in for and how long they were gone per break
-Allows for the ability to log into another user's register in the case they need to use their register. This will prevent any errors to be blamed on the main users if they happened under another user
-Prevents multiple managers from clocking out to ensure at least one is on the clock at all times
